    "Welcome! This lab will teach you how astronomers find exoplanets. To start, please go to Lesson 1 in the menu above and click on the buttons to be taken to the Python labs. These lessons are meant to be completed in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quickstart: Once you're in Jupyter and you can see the first lesson, you can run a cell by putting your cursor in the cell, or by clicking on the cell to select it, and pressing the play button on the top bar. You can also just use shift+enter to execute the selected cell.\n",

    "## To teachers and parents\n",
    "\n",
    "All are welcome to participate and learn from this program. We do not want to discourage students from participating because of their age or educational needs. We do, however, require some basic mathematics skills and concepts about units and numbers. This program is designed to be simple enough for a wide range of students to participate, and can grow in complexity based on a students interest level in the material. We encourage the use of our notebooks as an entry point for many coding and programming challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it is designed: a brief overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a repository of Jupyter Notebooks hosted on our own servers. These tools provide students with a individual portal to run code that we have written that they can edit or modify freely to aid their education. It can be accessed in most internet browsers and requires no installation of software. All they have to do is follow the links on this website to arrive at our lessons. Our code is open source, and is hosted on GitHub. If you are software savvy, and would like to contribute, please fork our repository and open a pull request! If you have any issues, or have feedback, please contact us at info@centreoftheuniverse.org\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving work\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work should be saved between sessions. If you haven't used your account in a long time, we may disable and delete it to allow room for other potential students. If you would like to export your work, you must print the notebook using Print Preview and saving the preview as either a PDF, HTML, or by printing a paper copy. A stable internet connection is also required. Notebooks that have been left unattended for some time (> 60 minutes) will automatically be closed and any unsaved work will also be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",

    "Please contact us with a detailed description of your problem at mailto:info@centeroftheuniverse.org.  "
