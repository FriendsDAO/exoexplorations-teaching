A `cell` is a unit of code in an application we are using called `Jupyter`. `Jupyter` is just a way for us to use our programming language, Python.\n",
    "After we have written our Python into a cell, we need to `execute` a cell's code. Executing is means we just want to run the program! In the same way that you `execute` a Google Search to tell Google what we want, we can execute code to tell Python what we want.\n",
